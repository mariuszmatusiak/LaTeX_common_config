	abstract = {The main topic of this research is the development of a new efficient method for solving fractional differential equations in the time domain using the Grünwald-Letnikov ({GL}) definition of the differintegral operator. The goal is to reduce or, in some cases, eliminate the necessity of introducing the maximum number of samples of the approximation, which is always a trade-off between accuracy, memory consumption, and computational speed. The algorithm involving Fast Fourier Transform and Fast Convolution operations has been proposed. The implementation in two different environments - the {MATLAB}/Simulink on a {PC} and on a hardware platform with the {STM}32H743 microcontroller - is described in this paper and the results of two iterations of experiments are presented. Fast Convolution algorithm is proven to be highly effective for processing block lengths \$\$N {\textbackslash}ge 128\$\$. In the most complex analyzed case (\$\$N=8192\$\$ samples) on the Intel\$\${\textbackslash}textregistered \$\$ Core\$\${\textasciicircum}{\textbackslash}mathrm\{{TM}\}\$\$ i5-8250U {CPU} reduction of the computation time reached \$\$85{\textbackslash}\%\$\$, compared to the implementation of the classic definition characterized by the \$\${\textbackslash}mathcal \{O\}(N{\textasciicircum}2)\$\$ complexity.},
